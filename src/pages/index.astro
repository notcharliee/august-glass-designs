						Crafting quality, handmade, eco friendly glass decor since 2014.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many years ago, a very clever person taught me how to work with glass, using the Tiffany method to create simple terrariums. Since then, I've been creating all sorts of glass bits and bobs in my Sussex workshop.
					</p>
					<p>
						I create a variety of items, ranging in size. Larger glass items can be collected from me directy at my workshop.
					</p>
					<p>
						Custom orders are welcome and any of my existing designs can be adapted whenever possible. I’m happy to combine shipping on more than one item ordered, just ask for more details.
					</p>
					<p>
						Oh yes and I have a ginger dog, who doesn’t care about anyone but himself but is still a good sidekick.
