						<p>Terrariums, home decor and glass gifts. Handmade in England.</p>
						<p>All of my work is completely handmade by me, giving each piece its own identity. I use good quality glass and materials, you wont find cheap factory made here!</p>
						<p>I’m happy to combine shipping on more than one item ordered. Custom orders are welcome and any of my designs can be adapted whenever possible.</p>
						<p>I try to be environmentally friendly and use recycled materials for my packaging to post your item to you.</p>

							<Review
								name="Max"
								message="I asked several stores for quotes for a custom project, and Jackie's was about the half the price. Communication was always on point; the product is top notch and was very securely packed. 10/10 wonderful craftmanship. only sore point is the shipping: if you are in Europe it will take approx 5 weeks to arrive because of customs. All in all, top store, will buy again!"
