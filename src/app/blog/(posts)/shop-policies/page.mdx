# Return Policy

I have a 14 day return policy, which means you have 14 days after receiving your item to request a return and a refund.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, and in its original packaging.

Return postage will not be refunded. Any customs charges will be deducted from your refund To start a return, you can contact me <Link href={"/contact"}>here</Link>.

## Damages and issues

Please inspect your order upon reception and contact me immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that I can evaluate the issue and make it right.

I will require photos of the item as well as the packaging it came in.

## Exchanges

The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.
