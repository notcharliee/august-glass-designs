# Fairs and Markets

I regularly sell at Paper Daisy events, particularly the Christmas markets they host at The Shoreham Centre and at Bhasvic.

I do plan to trade at more markets and fairs this year, as I really enjoy meeting my customers and the creative buzz of these events.

Here are the dates for the fairs and markets I plan to trade at in 2024:
